1) Print operands as they arrive

2) If stack is empty or contain a left parentheses on top of the stack then push the incoming
symbol onto the stack

3)if incoming symbol is left parenthses then push it into stack

4)if incoming symbol is right parentheses pop the stack until left parentheses encounter

5)if incoming symbol has higher precedence then top of the stack then push it into the stack

6)if incoming symbol has lower precedence then top of the stack then pop and print the top then test the
new incoming operator with the top of the stack

7)if incoming operator has equal precedence then go for the associativity rule 
   a)if associativity is left to right then pop and print the top of the stack and push the incoming
   operator 
   b)if associativity is right to left then push the incoming operator

8)print all the operators from the stack
