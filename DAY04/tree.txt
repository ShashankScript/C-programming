//Binary Tree are of 4 types


//i) full binary tree : each node have 2 children except leaf node

//ii)complete binary tree : All levels are completely filled except the last level as it is filled
//from left to right 

//iii)perefect binary tree : All internal nodes have 2 children and all leafs are at same level

//iv) degenerating binary tree : All internal nodes have 1 children

//v) full/strict/proper : each node have 0 or 2 children

//Traversal : Inorder : L Root R
//            Preorder: Root L R
//            Postorder: L R Root
